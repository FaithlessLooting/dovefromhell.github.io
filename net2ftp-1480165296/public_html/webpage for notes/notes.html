<h1>Images, sound and strings</h1>
<h2> Strings</h2>
<p id="strings">
ASCII stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange.Computers can only understand numbers, so an ASCII code is the numerical representation of a character such as 'a' or '@' or an action of some sort.
</p>
<p>
Back then, as mentioned above, IBM equipment by themselves used 9 different character sets. As Bob Bemer put it, they couldn't even talk to each other, let alone the outside world? This was midway through Bob Bemer's career at IBM and even then this was becoming quite a concern.In May of 1961 Bob submitted a proposal for a common computer code to the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). A committee called the X3.4 which represented most of the computer manufacturers of the time and chaired by an individual called John Auwaerter (vice president of the former Teletype Corporation) was created and immediately got to work on this proposal.
</p>
<h2>Images</h2>
<p>We saw that computer manufacturers got together and agreed how characters will be represented (the ASCII code). For graphics, there are several similar standards or formats. One of the original formats still in use is called a bitmap (.bmp). Bitmaps store every pixel of the image and thus results in files with large amounts of bytes. A simple bitmap drawing can easily exceed several megabytes. Two other common graphics formats used on the Internet are JPEG and GIF. JPEG and GIF are also compressed formats. This means that instead of storing every pixel, a file of this format stores the patterns of pixels.
</p>
<h2> Sound </h2>
<p> To convert an analog wave into digital, converters use a process called sampling. They sample the height of the sound wave at regular intervals of time, often small fractions of a second. If one byte is used to hold a single sample of an analog wave, then the wave can be one of 256 different heights (0 being the lowest height and 255 being the highest). These heights represent the decibel level of the sound. Thus a spoken word might occupy several hundred bytes - each being a sample of the sound wave of the voice at a small fraction of a second. If these 100 bytes were sent to a computer's speaker, the spoken word would be reproduced.
</p>
<p>
Like ASCII for characters and GIF and JPEG for pictures, sound has several agreed-upon formats for representing samples in bytes. WAV is a common format in which every sample is stored, similar to the way that bitmap stores every pixel of an image. A more common sound format is MP3. MP3 is a compressed format, like JPEG and GIF are compressed format for images. MP3 does not store every sample, instead it stores only samples that the human ear can hear and then condenses these samples to patterns. It is these patterns that are stored so that another computer, or MP3 player, can read them and reproduce the sound.

<h1>Number systems</h1>
<h2> Base 2</h2>
<p> base 2, also called binary is the number system computers understand, it has 2 digits, one and zero</p>
<p> here is a representation of counting in binary</p>
<iframe frameborder="0|0" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/Binary_counter.gif"></iframe> 
<p> you add binary numbers much like you can do with denery, just use the carrying system</p>

<h2> Base 10 </h2>
<p> base 10 is the normal system we use in maths, it has 10 digits and works in powers of 10 (10,100,1000), if you need to learn how to add in base 10 then i would give up computing now</p>
<p> this is how to convert to base 10 </p>

<h1> binary things</h1>
<h3>Representing real numbers in binary</h3>
			<p>Floating point numbers in binary are similar to base 10 standard form. A 8 bit binary number for example, may use a 5 bit <strong style="color:yellow;">mantissa</strong> and a 3 bit <strong style="color:green;">exponent</strong>.</p>
			<p>The <strong style="color:yellow;">mantissa</strong> refers to the numerical part of the standard form (ie the bit thats going to be multiplied), and works like a normal binary decimal:</p>
			<table style="width:350px">
				<tr><td>-1</td><td><strong>.</strong></td><td>1/2</td><td>1/4</td><td>1/8</td><td>1/16</td></tr>
				<tr><td>0</td><td><strong>.</strong></td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr>
			</table>
			<p>NB: the decimal point isn't it's own bit, the processor already 'knows' it should be there</p>
			<br/>
			<p>The <strong style="color:black;">exponent</strong> refers to the part of the standard form that is multiplying the mantissa. It is expressed as a 2's compliment binary integer</p>
			<table style="width:180px">
				<tr><td>-4</td><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr>
				<tr><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>
			</table>
			<p>The exponent here is 3, meaning the mantissa is multiplied by 2<sup>3</sup> = 8. i.e: the decimal point moves 3 places to the right:<p>
			<p><strong style="color:black;">0.1101</strong> x 10<sup><strong style="color:blue;">11</strong></sup> = 110.1</p>
			<p><strong style="color:black;">0.8125</strong> x 2<sup><strong style="color:blue;">3</strong></sup> = 6.5</p>

<h1> databases</h1>
<p> 
would a flat file database be good for storing friends details?
</p><p>
yes because there won’t be many records
</p><p>
what about for a businesses?
</p><p>
no because there will be too many records to keep track off
</p>
<h2> Advantages of flat file databases</h2>
<p>
1.All records are stored in one place
</p><p>
2.Easy to understand
</p><p>
3.Simple sorting and filtering can be carried out#
</p><p>
4.Can use a standard spreadsheet to store it
</p>
<h2>Disadvantages of flat file databases</h2>
<p>
1. Potential duplication. With perhaps thousands of records in a file, it can be a very tedious process to spot duplicated records. Especially if more than one person is maintaining the table.
</p><p>
2. Non-unique records. Notice that Mr & Mrs Jones have identical ID's '2'. There is nothing in a flat file system to stop this. But it is a very poor idea to have identical ID's in a database.
</p><p>
3. Harder to update. Suppose this table now needs to also store their work details - this will result in multiple records for each person. Again, this is fine - but suppose Sandra Jones now wanted to be known as 'Sandra Thompson'? Now multiple records need to be updated.
</p><p>
4. Inherently inefficient. What if an email field needs to be added?. If there are tens of thousands of records, there may be many people having no email address, but every record in a flat file database has to have the same fields, whether they are used or not.
</p><p>
5. Harder to change data format. Suppose the telephone numbers now have to have a dash between the area code and the rest of the number, like this 0223-44033. Adding that extra dash over tens of thousands of records would be a significant task in a flat file database.
</p><p>
6. Poor at complex queries. Flat files are excellent for simple filtering. For example, show all records where the field 'City' contains Hull. But for anything a bit more complicated, a flat file becomes very difficult to use. For example, find all records whose post code contains '23'.
</p><p>
7. Almost no security. You can protect a flat file database using a password for opening it. But once it is open, that person can usually see all fields. This is often not a good thing, for example there may be a confidential field containing their salary that only some people should be able to see.
